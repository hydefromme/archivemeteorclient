> [!NOTE]
> u can skip the first two if you are using a other client to run minecraft most of them already use fabric and java and auto install them for u, but u may have to install java and fabric if ur gonna switch back to the normal client.

## download fabric
first you will need to get java (skip if you already have java installed or use a other client)

heres a tutorial for it: [how-to-get-java-2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qILdA4gjwrU&ab_channel=TheBreakdown)

## download java
after that you will need to get fabric (you can skip this if you already have or use a other client)

## get the mod
then go to the versions folder on the repository and download the version you want

after your downloaded it do windows + R

in the text box type "Appdata"

click on enter and open "Roaming"

then ".Minecraft" if u use any other client search for one called that

after that open the "mods" folder and put the file in it

then you can just close that and restart your minecraft!
